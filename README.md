Code to support more efficient alternatives to animal models. 

Millions of animals die each year in testing, yet approximately 90% of this testing fails and doesn't result in new drugs or therapies for people.

Multiple alternatives exist that can provide more humane and efficient (faster, cheaper) modeling and testing. These include:

1. Organ-on-a-Chip Technology
What It Is: Small devices containing human cells that simulate the functions of organs such as the heart, liver, lungs, and brain.
Benefits: Provides a controlled environment to study disease processes, drug interactions, and toxicity with human-specific data.
Example: Harvard’s Wyss Institute has developed lung-on-a-chip technology to study respiratory diseases.

2. In Vitro (Cell Culture) Models
What It Is: Human cells grown in laboratory settings to study biological processes and test drug effects.
Benefits: Avoids cross-species differences, offers high reproducibility, and allows for high-throughput testing.
Limitations: May lack the complexity of whole-organism responses.
Example: Cancer research often relies on tumor cell lines to screen drugs.

3. Computer Simulations and AI Models
What It Is: Advanced computational models simulate human biology, disease progression, and drug effects.
Benefits: Rapid, cost-effective, and capable of analyzing vast datasets.
Example: Virtual physiological human models simulate entire organ systems.

4. 3D Bioprinting
What It Is: Technology that prints three-dimensional structures made of human cells, such as tissue or organ models.
Benefits: Provides a platform for studying human-specific responses without relying on animals.
Example: bioprinted liver tissues used to test drug toxicity.

5. Human Organoids
What It Is: Miniature, lab-grown versions of human organs created from stem cells.
Benefits: Mimic the architecture and function of human organs, providing a more accurate model for drug testing.
Example: Brain organoids are used to study neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s.

6. Microdosing in Humans
What It Is: Administering very small doses of experimental drugs to humans to study pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics without significant risk.
Benefits: Avoids animal use while providing direct human data.
Limitations: Limited to early-phase studies.

7. Epidemiological and Clinical Studies
What It Is: Research using data from human populations to understand disease patterns and treatment outcomes.
Benefits: Focuses directly on human biology and real-world conditions.
